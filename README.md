# Yawn detection implementation on an Android App | Drowsiness detector
This app detects if a driver is yawning, hence showing signs of drowsiness. This is implemented using a popular machine learning algorithm for computer vision called Convolutional Neural Networks. No internet connection is required for this app, since the model is not server based. This app can be used for any road trip where there's a possibility of a car crash due to drowsiness. Hopefully, this app can be worked upon to save lives.

# TensorFlow Lite Object Detection Android
### Overview
This is a camera app that continuously detects the yawns (bounding boxes and classes) in the frames seen by your device's front camera, using a float [MobileNet SSD](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) model trained on the [COCO dataset](http://cocodataset.org/).
